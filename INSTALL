# Configuration

* run install.php to make sure all dependencies are installed
  - if you are only creating a basic development installation you will only need:
     perl
     pygmentize (part of pygments)
     PHP Memache extension

* Copy all files from ./application/config/example to ./application/config
* Change them to fit your needs
  - don't change config.php, use config-local.php to override it when needed

* The necessary database tables are created/updated automatically when accessing your pastebin

* Copy htaccess.txt to .htaccess if you want shorter URLs
  (also change the config setting)

* Add ./crontab or something similar to the user's crontab


# Generate the first user

* Go to base_url/user/hash_password to generate a password hash

* Run the following SQL command
   insert into users
   (username, password, email, referrer)
   values ("your_name", "hash_from_above", "you@foo.com", 0)
