This file lists major, incompatible or otherwise important changes, you should look at it after every update.

2014-11-02 Multipastes can now be downloaded as tarballs. The tarballs are
           cached and you have to run `php index.php file cron` to clean them up. Calling
           it more often than once a day is recommended (the example changed to every ten
           minutes). Also note that the default maximum tarball size is rather low (50MiB),
           you might want to increase it. Also make sure the phar.so extension is loaded..

2014-10-19 Postgresl support
2014-09-20 All PHP errors are now converted to exceptions and execution
